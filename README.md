The Brief

Your task is to build an interactive website using web technologies. Your project should make use of the range of techniques you have explored during the module and demonstrate your understanding of these techniques and ability to deploy them successfully. For this assessment you have to decide a theme on which you will create your website.

Theme 1 – Educational
In this theme, you can select any schools, universities or educational institutes online or physical. It could be a profitable or non-profitable educational institute.

Theme 2 – Portfolio
In this theme, you have to create your own personal portfolio website that showcases your work, experience and overall development, something that you can use professionally in future.

Theme 3 – Medical
In this theme, you can create a website related to the medical field such as hospitals, pharmacies or nutrition, it can be related to physical therapy or even mental therapy consultation.

Theme 4 – Gaming
In this theme, you can create a website that showcases famous games in general or a specific online game that will have its reviews rating and impact. You can also create a website related to a specific sport.

Theme 5 – Organisation
In this theme, you can create a website that can be related to a business, either your own or the one you like. It could be a profitable or non-profitable organisation online or physical.

For the above themes, you can pick/adapt any existing website as your reference idea, or make one up. There are some creative/technical constraints to consider:

● The piece must deploy HTML5 and CSS.
● The website must include at least 5 pages in which the user
must be able to make navigational decisions (e.g. pick where they want
to go next).
● Your website should include media assets (i.e. still images, moving
images, (audio or video if possible)) to make your website more interactive and engaging.
● Javascript and related languages/technologies may be used to enhance
your website.
